## Overview
This repo contains the code developed for the papers:

- Estimating wingbeat frequency on hovering hummingbirds by using a no-labeling learning computer vision approach.
- Identifying pausing behavior on hummingbirds’ flight by using computer vision and signal analysis.

It contains an algorithm to detect, calssify and track hummingbirds as well as a method to obtain a frecuency and pause during flight behivior.
